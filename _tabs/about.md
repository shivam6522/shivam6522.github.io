I am a Passionate programmar, problem solver and developer. I love solving and optimising problems as well as I follow best programming practices to write cleaner, modular and understandable code. I am highly interested in software development, especially back end development and working on large scale projects. I also have pretty good experience with django web development and rest framework. Additionally, I have participated in several competitive programming contests including codejam and kickstart etc. When it comes to my problem solving skills, I have solved 500+ quality problems on various coding platforms like Codechef, Hackerrank, Leetcode and Codeforces etc. I have some hands on experience with big cloud platforms like AWS and Google Cloud too.  I like experimenting with softwares and tools in my free time.
