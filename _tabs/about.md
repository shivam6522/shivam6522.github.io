I am an Passionate programmar, problem solver and developer. I am very much interested in software development, especially back end development and working on large scale projects. In addition to this, I also have pretty good experience with django web development and rest framework. Additionally, I have participated in several competitive programming contests like codejam and kickstart etc. When it comes to my problem solving skills, I have solved 500+ problems on various coding platforms like Codechef, Hackerrank, Leetcode and Codeforces etc. I have earned gold badge in C programming and SQL in hackerrank. I also have some hands on experience with big cloud platforms like AWS and Google Cloud. I always give my 100% effort and required time to the task assigned to me. I always welcome and enthusiastic about learning something new.
